# Personalized Movie Recommendation Engine

## Overview
This project is a personalized movie recommendation engine that suggests movies based on a user's unique preferences and ratings. 
By comparing a user's ratings to public ratings and analyzing patterns in genres, directors, and cast members, the engine generates tailored movie recommendations.

The system leverages:

User data from platforms like Letterboxd.
Public ratings and metadata from APIs (e.g., TMDb, IMDb).
Machine learning techniques for enhanced recommendations.
